# BI Project README

## Project Scenario Summary
During my interview with Google Fiber's customer service team for the BI analyst position, I was tasked with designing a dashboard using fictional data to monitor and improve customer satisfaction. The project goal was to explore trends in repeat calls and understand how effectively the team was addressing customer inquiries on their first contact. By analyzing the types of customer issues that generated repeat calls and identifying trends in different market cities, the dashboard aimed to provide valuable insights for improving customer experience.

To meet the stakeholders' requirements, I created charts and tables to measure repeat calls by first contact date, explore repeat calls by market and problem type, and showcase trends on a weekly, monthly, and quarterly basis. The success of the project would be measured by the ability to reduce call volume and increase customer satisfaction. Throughout the project, I kept in mind the need for an accessible dashboard with features like large print and text-to-speech alternatives to accommodate different user preferences. By addressing the stakeholders' questions and ensuring the privacy and anonymity of the data, I aimed to demonstrate my knowledge and skills as a BI analyst to potential employers.
